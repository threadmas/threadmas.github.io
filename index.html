			<h2>You are invited to a day of festivities on December 6th</h2>

			<p class="poem">Twas the night before threadmas and all through the land
			<br>
			Each of our friends were up gathering plans</p>

			<p class="poem">Sophie was drunk just singing’ a song
			<br>
			And Blaise was in bed tossing his dong</p>

			<p class="poem">Sean had a smoke and looked for St nick
			<br>
			While Troth had problems finding his dick</p>

			<p class="poem">Max checked the chimney and closed all the doors
			<br>
			Ginge stayed up tindring whores</p>

			<p class="poem">Leila got hungry and in a mad dash
			<br>
			Took money from Ian, she spent all his cash</p>

			<p class="poem">Will hated Christmas and going down south
			<br>
			So Lu called him Scrooge and stuck coal in his mouth</p>

			<p class="poem">Sam had been naughty so this year got nothing
			<br>
			Michelle however, she’d earned a good stuffing</p>

			<p class="poem">For Alix it was already Christmas at home
			<br>
			And rue was lost with no bars on her phone</p>

			<p class="poem">So this year for christmas lets all join in cheer
			<br>
			For some threadmas festivities, food and beer.</p>
